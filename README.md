# Structural Intelligence (SI)

A philosophical framework for describing how human reality is organized into form: how meaning, roles, constraints, and coherence hold—or fail—under pressure.

## Concepts
- **Invariance Constraint**: a non-tradable baseline term that blocks steerability under reward-pressure.
- **Fixed Worth**: internal worth that never fades; worth treated as invariant rather than priced by signals.
- **Variable Worth**: worth experienced as fluctuating with signals (approval, status, desirability, correctness).
- **Pricing Self**: a configuration where valuation regulates cognition and revision is metabolized as devaluation.
