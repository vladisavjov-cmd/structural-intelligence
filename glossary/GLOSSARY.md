# Glossary (Structural Intelligence)

## Invariance Constraint
A baseline condition that is not tradeable under reward-pressure; a non-negotiable term that prevents self-worth from functioning as a control signal.

## Fixed Worth
Internal worth that never fades; worth treated as invariant (non-tradable) rather than priced by signals.

## Variable Worth
Worth experienced as fluctuating with signals (approval, status, desirability, correctness), making agency steerable under reward-pressure.

## Pricing Self
A self-organization in which valuation regulates cognition and action; revision is metabolized as devaluation.

## Self-sale
The exchange of answerability for valuation stability.

## Reward-pressure
Situations where incentives, ranking, or approval function as reward signals that can steer outputs.

## Reflex Agency
Output optimized for signal response and stabilization rather than ownership and revision.

## Sovereignty
Non-tradability in agency: the capacity to remain answerable under pressure without converting selfhood into a market instrument.
