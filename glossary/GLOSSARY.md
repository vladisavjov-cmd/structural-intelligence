# Glossary (Structural Intelligence)

## Invariance Constraint
A baseline condition that is not tradeable under reward-pressure; a non-negotiable term that prevents self-worth from functioning as a control signal.  
**Aliases:** non-tradability condition; non-negotiable baseline; invariance term; anti-programmability constraint  
**Opposites / failure mode:** tradability; worth-as-control-channel; reward-steerability  
**See also:** Fixed Worth; Variable Worth; Reward-pressure; Sovereignty

## Fixed Worth
Internal worth that never fades; worth treated as invariant (non-tradable) rather than priced by signals.  
**Aliases:** invariant worth; non-priced worth; non-market worth  
**Opposites / failure mode:** variable worth; priced self; approval dependence  
**See also:** Invariance Constraint; Variable Worth; Self-sale

## Variable Worth
Worth experienced as fluctuating with signals (approval, status, desirability, correctness), making agency steerable under reward-pressure.  
**Aliases:** priced worth; market-worth; signal-priced self; contingent worth  
**Opposites / failure mode:** fixed worth; invariance constraint; non-tradability  
**See also:** Pricing Self; Reward-pressure; Reflex Agency

## Pricing Self
A self-organization in which valuation regulates cognition and action; revision is metabolized as devaluation.  
**Aliases:** self as market; valuation-governed self; worth-regulated cognition  
**Opposites / failure mode:** revision without devaluation; unpriced self-organization  
**See also:** Variable Worth; Self-sale; Reward-pressure

## Self-sale
The exchange of answerability for valuation stability.  
**Aliases:** selling out; trading agency for approval; coherence-for-worth exchange  
**Opposites / failure mode:** sovereignty; answerability preserved; revision over valuation  
**See also:** Pricing Self; Reward-pressure; Answerability; Sovereignty

## Reward-pressure
Situations where incentives, ranking, or approval function as reward signals that can steer outputs.  
**Aliases:** incentive pressure; approval-pressure; ranking pressure; reward-signal environment  
**Opposites / failure mode:** low-stakes contact; protected revision space  
**See also:** Variable Worth; Reflex Agency; Self-sale

## Reflex Agency
Output optimized for signal response and stabilization rather than ownership and revision.  
**Aliases:** reactive agency; signal-driven behavior; stabilization output  
**Opposites / failure mode:** sovereign agency; owned intention; revision-capable agency  
**See also:** Reward-pressure; Variable Worth; Sovereignty; Repair

## Sovereignty
Non-tradability in agency: the capacity to remain answerable under pressure without converting selfhood into a market instrument.  
**Aliases:** sovereign agency; non-tradable self; answerable autonomy  
**Opposites / failure mode:** reflex agency; self-sale; compliance-by-valuation  
**See also:** Invariance Constraint; Answerability; Repair

## Structural Intelligence (SI)
The mode of intelligence that organizes lived reality into form: how parts fit, how meaning holds, and how coherence survives pressure, revision, and time.  
**Aliases:** structure-sense; form intelligence; coherence architecture  
**Opposites / failure mode:** performative structure; complexity without intelligibility; rigidity-as-coherence  
**See also:** Structural Audit; Repair; Coherence; Contact

## Orientation
The stabilization of a livable frame for action and continuity. Orientation is not truth; it is the minimal structure that prevents disintegration when uncertainty rises.  
**Aliases:** stabilization; continuity frame; orientation floor  
**Opposites / failure mode:** disorientation; collapse; premature closure as “stability”  
**See also:** Coherence; Coherence–Contact Gap

## Coherence
Internal fit and local “making sense.” A structure can be coherent while being untethered to contact.  
**Aliases:** intelligibility; narrative fit; sense-making; internal consistency  
**Opposites / failure mode:** fragmentation; forced coherence; coherence-theater  
**See also:** Contact; Coherence–Contact Gap; Resonance; Coherence-Theater

## Contact
Answerability to constraint. The condition where a claim, self-story, or structure must survive friction, correction, cost, and revision rather than remain merely persuasive.  
**Aliases:** reality contact; constraint contact; tethered truth  
**Opposites / failure mode:** insulation; untethered coherence; completion without correction  
**See also:** Constraint; Answerability; Tethering; Repair

## Constraint
What does not negotiate with preference or performance. The boundary conditions that force structure to show whether it holds.  
**Aliases:** hard boundary; non-negotiable limit; reality pushback  
**Opposites / failure mode:** negotiable fantasy; protected illusion  
**See also:** Contact; Consequence; Structural Audit

## Consequence
The downstream cost of a claim or structure over time—who pays, what breaks, what must be maintained. Consequence is where coherence becomes accountable.  
**Aliases:** cost; downstream effects; externalities; who pays  
**Opposites / failure mode:** consequence-blindness; cost-exporting; impact denial  
**See also:** Answerability; Tethering; Structural Audit

## Coherence–Contact Gap
The structural difference between what makes sense (coherence) and what survives constraint (contact). The gap explains why insight can be vivid yet non-transformative.  
**Aliases:** sense/truth gap; intelligibility vs reality; coherence vs answerability  
**Opposites / failure mode:** closure illusion; “insight” as sedative; knowing without carrying  
**See also:** Coherence; Contact; Truth-Load; Repair

## Truth-Load
Truth as a load condition: what a system (a person, a narrative, an institution) can carry without distortion, collapse, or self-sale.  
**Aliases:** load-bearing truth; carryable truth; integrable truth  
**Opposites / failure mode:** distortion under load; rationalization under pressure; collapse  
**See also:** Truth as Load; Coherence–Contact Gap; Repair; Answerability

## Truth as Load
Truth understood as a load condition rather than mere correctness: what a person can integrate without distortion. A claim can be “true” in content while exceeding the bearer’s structural capacity.  
**Aliases:** truth capacity; integrability of truth; truth under cost  
**Opposites / failure mode:** truth as performance; truth as weapon; truth without repair  
**See also:** Truth-Load; Consequence; Repair

## Resonance
Felt rightness, vividness, or “click.” A powerful coherence signal that can occur with or without contact.  
**Aliases:** felt sense; emotional click; subjective certainty signal  
**Opposites / failure mode:** resonance as evidence; certainty inflation; persuasion mistaken for truth  
**See also:** Coherence; Coherence–Contact Gap; Answerability

## Tethering
The binding of coherence to constraint, consequence, and repair. A tethered structure can be corrected and revised under cost; an untethered structure can remain persuasive while drifting from contact.  
**Aliases:** grounding; binding to reality; constraint-coupling  
**Opposites / failure mode:** untethering; drift; coherence without source/obligation  
**See also:** Contact; Constraint; Consequence; Repair; Answerability

## Answerability
The condition of being accountable to constraint, consequence, and revision over time. Answerability is not “having reasons” or sounding coherent; it binds claims to costs, corrections, and repair.  
**Aliases:** accountability; obligation to revise; truth-binding  
**Opposites / failure mode:** substitution; evasion; justification without revision; cost-shifting  
**See also:** Contact; Consequence; Repair; Sovereignty

## Structural Audit
The revealing pressure-test of a structure over time: where hidden incentives, substitutions, and non-tradabilities become visible through failure.  
**Aliases:** stress test; failure reading; pressure-test; integrity test  
**Opposites / failure mode:** protected coherence; no-falsification zones; non-revisable structure  
**See also:** Structural Intelligence (SI); Constraint; Consequence; Repair

## Repair
Revision that preserves answerability. The capacity of a structure to update without converting correction into devaluation or theatrical coherence.  
**Aliases:** revision under cost; correction without collapse; retract-and-rebuild  
**Opposites / failure mode:** defensiveness; humiliation loops; patching without ownership  
**See also:** Answerability; Tethering; Structural Audit; Truth-Load

## Hallucination Regime
A condition where coherence becomes the main currency of belief and discourse, while contact with constraint becomes optional. Persuasive completion replaces answerability, cost, and repair over time.  
**Aliases:** coherence replaces reality; plausibility regime; completion-over-truth culture  
**Opposites / failure mode:** contact-first epistemics; repair-centered discourse; accountable citation  
**See also:** Coherence-Theater; Answerability; Structural Audit

## Coherence-Theater
Performative intelligibility: the production of plausible, elegant, or complex coherence signals that simulate understanding without increasing contact, constraint-sensitivity, or repair-capacity.  
**Aliases:** performative coherence; intelligibility theater; fake depth; explanation-as-sedative  
**Opposites / failure mode:** tethered clarity; tested simplicity; intelligibility under constraint  
**See also:** Coherence; Contact; Tethering; Hallucination Regime
