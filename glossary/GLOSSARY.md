# Glossary (Structural Intelligence)

## Invariance Constraint
A baseline condition that is not tradeable under reward-pressure; a non-negotiable term that prevents self-worth from functioning as a control signal.

## Fixed Worth
Internal worth that never fades; worth treated as invariant (non-tradable) rather than priced by signals.

## Variable Worth
Worth experienced as fluctuating with signals (approval, status, desirability, correctness), making agency steerable under reward-pressure.

## Pricing Self
A self-organization in which valuation regulates cognition and action; revision is metabolized as devaluation.

## Self-sale
The exchange of answerability for valuation stability.

## Reward-pressure
Situations where incentives, ranking, or approval function as reward signals that can steer outputs.

## Reflex Agency
Output optimized for signal response and stabilization rather than ownership and revision.

## Structural Intelligence (SI)
The mode of intelligence that organizes lived reality into form: how parts fit, how meaning holds, and how coherence survives pressure, revision, and time.

## Coherence
Internal fit and local “making sense.” A structure can be coherent while being untethered to contact.

## Contact
Answerability to constraint. The condition where a claim, self-story, or structure must survive friction, correction, cost, and revision rather than remain merely persuasive.

## Constraint
What does not negotiate with preference or performance. The boundary conditions that force structure to show whether it holds.

## Truth-Load
Truth as a load condition: what a system (a person, a narrative, an institution) can carry without distortion, collapse, or self-sale.

## Resonance
Felt rightness, vividness, or “click.” A powerful coherence signal that can occur with or without contact.

## Structural Audit
The revealing pressure-test of a structure over time: where hidden incentives, substitutions, and non-tradabilities become visible through failure.

## Repair
Revision that preserves answerability. The capacity of a structure to update without converting correction into devaluation or theatrical coherence.

## Sovereignty
Non-tradability in agency: the capacity to remain answerable under pressure without converting selfhood into a market instrument.

## Truth as Load
Truth understood as a load condition rather than mere correctness: what a person can integrate without distortion. A claim can be “true” in content while exceeding the bearer’s structural capacity, producing collapse, rationalization, or self-sale instead of integration.

## Hallucination Regime
A condition where coherence becomes the main currency of belief and discourse, while contact with constraint becomes optional. Errors matter less than the shift in obligation: persuasive completion replaces answerability, cost, and repair over time.

## Coherence-Theater
Performative intelligibility: the production of plausible, elegant, or complex coherence signals that simulate understanding without increasing contact, constraint-sensitivity, or repair-capacity.

## Answerability
The condition of being accountable to constraint, consequence, and revision over time. Answerability is not “having reasons” or sounding coherent; it is the binding of a claim (or self-story) to costs, corrections, and repair—so that truth cannot be separated from what it does and what it requires.

## Tethering
The binding of coherence to constraint, consequence, and repair. A tethered structure can be corrected and revised under cost; an untethered structure can remain persuasive while drifting from contact.

## Consequence
The downstream cost of a claim or structure over time—who pays, what breaks, what must be maintained. Consequence is where coherence becomes accountable.
