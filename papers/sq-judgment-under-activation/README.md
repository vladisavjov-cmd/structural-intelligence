### Abstract
“Spiritual intelligence” (SQ) is usually treated as an aesthetic: calmness, kindness, “being evolved.” This paper treats it as a capacity with a hard edge: SQ is the ability to keep judgment online under activation. When activation rises—fear, shame, humiliation, longing—people don’t simply reason poorly. They undergo a regime shift: coherence becomes a survival function, and meaning becomes a sedative. Under that load, IQ becomes a rationalization engine, EQ becomes a persuasion engine, and even SI becomes a weapon. SQ names the stabilizing faculty that prevents competence from being conscripted by panic. SQ is framed as an internal Hard Floor: the place where you can still be interrupted by reality even when your nervous system wants a finished story.
