### Abstract
Many contemporary accounts treat insight as intrinsically therapeutic or epistemically progressive: to understand a pattern is assumed to weaken it. This paper argues that insight is primarily a representational achievement—coherence at the level of explanation—while change requires contact with constraint. The boundary marker “this makes sense… but it doesn’t work” names the gap between coherent understanding and the conditions that actually govern behavior over time. Building on a coherence/contact distinction, the paper proposes that insight becomes effective only when it is metabolized into structures that can survive time, contradiction, cost, repair demands, and relational friction. It then develops an epistemic ethics of intervention: because coherence often functions as an orientation floor, dismantling another person’s coherence without consent can destabilize them without providing a livable replacement—making “truth” harmful through bad timing, not falsity.
