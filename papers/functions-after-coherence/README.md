### Abstract
If coherence is abundant and cheap—especially in an AI-saturated environment—then consciousness can no longer be defined mainly as the production of intelligible narratives. This paper treats coherence-seeking as an early, necessary function (orientation for continuity and action), but argues that once coherence stops being a reliable signal of truth or stability, post-coherence functions must come online. It offers a functional taxonomy of these load-bearing capacities: tolerance of ambiguity without premature closure, constraint-sensitivity (where reality will push back), cost-visibility (who pays for a belief), repair-capacity (updating without humiliation or collapse), exit-capacity (leaving non-load-bearing structures cleanly), hospitable containment (allowing others to remain stable without being corrected), and meta-orientation (choosing which function to deploy). In this frame, “wisdom” is the coordinated operation of these functions: remaining intact without forcing closure, and letting contact reorganize form without domination, denial, or despair.
