### Abstract
Why does recognizing truth so often fail to liberate—sometimes even increasing paralysis or repetition? This paper argues that in lived human life, truth is not only propositional correctness but a load condition: truth is what a consciousness can bear without defensive distortion. Human truth is therefore inseparable from structure—capacities of orientation, repair, cost-ownership, and temporal stability that allow reality to be integrated rather than merely known. Using a coherence/contact distinction, the paper defines truth-load as the pressure exerted by contact (time, contradiction, cost, repair, relational friction) and frames Structural Intelligence as the capacity to test whether a belief is genuinely load-bearing or merely stabilizing.
