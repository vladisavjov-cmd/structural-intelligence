### Abstract
Wisdom is often treated as rare knowledge possessed by sages or ascetics. This paper argues that what looks like “special knowledge” is better understood as a structural state produced by a repeatable phenomenological process: the progressive stripping of non-load-bearing coherence. Orientation (coherence) is usually restored before truth is welcomed—especially when stability feels at stake—so truth becomes livable only as the subject develops enough structural capacity to bear contact (time, cost, contradiction, repair, relational friction) without defensive distortion. The paper introduces the “monastic effect”: withdrawal reduces volatility, allowing coherence to dissolve and revealing what remains when explanations can’t be used as insulation. In the AI era—where coherent form is abundant and cheap—the task shifts from producing explanations to cultivating discrimination: Structural Intelligence as the ability to detect tethering and resist coherence-theater (intelligibility without answerability). Wisdom is described non-mystically as integration, not revelation: truth is not merely known, but carried.
