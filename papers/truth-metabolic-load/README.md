### Abstract
AI can produce clean coherence with almost no cost. It can sound like insight in seconds. Humans don’t work that way. Humans pay. The body is where the bill shows up. This paper argues that suffering isn’t just an accident or a flaw. Often it’s the audit: the moment your inner story hits the edge of reality. Truth is not just information. Truth is what you can actually carry. And carrying costs energy, time, and change. Structural Intelligence doesn’t “remove” suffering. It helps you separate necessary load from wasted friction—so you can stay in contact without breaking.
